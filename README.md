# Group-14-BioHackathon---Leukemia

## Leukemia Overview
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal blood cells. Leukemia is the most common cancer in children younger than 15, although it occurs most frequently in adults older than 55. 

#### Symptoms
From a clinical perspective some common symptoms of leukemia include: fatige and weakness, frequent or severe infections, easy bruising or bleeding, fever or chills, night sweats, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, bone pain or tenderness, and petechiae (tiny red spots under skin).

#### Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnosis of leukemia typically involves: physical examination, blood tests (CBC and peripheral blood smear), bone marrow biopsies, cytogenetic analysis, immunophenotyping, and various molecular testing for genetic abnormalities. 

#### Prognostic Criteria
The prognosis of leukemia varies depending on the type of leukemmia. The key prognostic factors that physicians consider before predicting a patients clincal outcome include: age of patient, white blood cell count at diagnosis, cytogenic abnormalities, response to initial treatment, presence of minimal residual diisease after treatment, and various comorbidities. 

#### Frontline Treatments
Treatment options for leukeumia include: Chemotherapy, Targeted Therapy using drugs focused on specific abnormalities within cancer cells (tyrosine kinase inhibitors, FLT3 inhibitors and IDH inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, Ziftomenib or Revumenib are common examples), Immunotherapy, Stem Cell Transplantation, Radiation Therapy, and various clinica trials. 

#### Criteria for Successful Treatment
Success of treatment can be measured by the achievement of complete remission, minimal residual diease negativity, overall survival and disease-free survival, and overall quality of life improvements. 

#### Options if Frontline Therapy Fails
If the initial treatment is unsuccessful, options include: beginning alternative chemotheraphy regiments, clincal trials of new drugs or unique combinations, stem cell transplantation (if not done initially), CAR T-cell therapy, and Palliatve care for sympom management.

#### Organs Involved in Leukemia Expression
Leukemia primarily affects the blood-forming tissues and organs:
1. Bone marrow: Primary site of leukemia development
2. Blood: Circulating leukemic cells affect the entire body
3. Lymph Nodes: Often enlarged due to accumulation of leukemic cells
4. Spleen: Also may become enlarged (splenomegaly)
5. Liver: Can be affected, leading to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly)
6. Central Nervous System: In some cases, leukemia can spread to the brain and spinal cord.
