## Leukemia Overview
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal blood cells. Leukemia is the most common cancer in children younger than 15, although it occurs most frequently in adults older than 55. 

#### Symptoms

#### Prognostic Criteria
The prognosis of leukemia varies depending on the type of leukemmia. The key prognostic factors that physicians consider before predicting a patients clincal outcome include: age of patient
